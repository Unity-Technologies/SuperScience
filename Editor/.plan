Refactor "Layer Users" to "Layer Usages"
Upgrade Prefab Layer Users to display GameObjects the same way Scene Layer Users does
Update scene scanning to be async in MissingReferences and Layer Usages
Refactor scanning options to be display options so we don't require a re-scan
Rename MissingReferenceWindow base class to AnalysisWindow and refactor to share code Prefab/Tag usages and Solid Color Textures
  Split out Folder, GameObjectContainer, etc. types into their own files, share among all analysis windows
Create options to allow Layer Usages windows to skip scanning for layer masks (SerializedProperty access is the bottleneck)
Allow filtering Layer Usages with multiple layers
Use rich text for GameObject labels (bold tag or layer, etc.)
